# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The core learning architecture serves as the foundational system that orchestrates personalized learning experiences across multiple education levels (K-12, college/university, professional development). This architecture integrates AI-powered analytics, content recommendation engines, peer collaboration systems, and progress tracking to create adaptive learning paths that evolve with each learner's needs and goals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Profile and Learning Assessment System

**User Story:** As a learner of any education level, I want the system to understand my current knowledge, learning preferences, and goals, so that I can receive personalized learning experiences tailored to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL collect basic demographic information (age range, education level, learning goals)
2. WHEN a user completes the initial assessment THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive skill profile with knowledge gaps identified
3. WHEN a user updates their learning preferences THEN the system SHALL adapt future recommendations within 24 hours
4. IF a user is under 18 THEN the system SHALL implement additional privacy protections and parental consent mechanisms
5. WHEN a user's skill assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL assign them to appropriate difficulty levels for each subject area

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Learning Path Generation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to create a personalized learning path that adapts to my progress and learning style, so that I can achieve my educational goals efficiently without getting overwhelmed or bored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes their initial assessment THEN the system SHALL generate a personalized learning path within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a user completes a learning session THEN the system SHALL update their learning path based on performance metrics
3. IF a user struggles with a concept (< 70% comprehension) THEN the system SHALL provide additional foundational content before advancing
4. WHEN a user demonstrates mastery (> 90% comprehension) THEN the system SHALL accelerate the learning path and introduce advanced concepts
5. WHEN generating learning paths THEN the system SHALL consider the user's available time, preferred learning formats, and schedule constraints
6. IF the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback static learning path based on the user's education level

### Requirement 3: Multi-Source Content Recommendation Engine

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to receive relevant educational content from various sources (YouTube, educational platforms, peer-created content) that matches my learning style and current skill level, so that I can learn from diverse, high-quality materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests content recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide at least 5 relevant resources from different sources
2. WHEN recommending content THEN the system SHALL filter for age-appropriate materials based on user profile
3. WHEN a user rates content THEN the system SHALL incorporate this feedback into future recommendations within the same session
4. IF content is flagged as inappropriate THEN the system SHALL remove it from recommendations within 1 hour
5. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL prioritize content with high peer success rates for similar learners
6. WHEN a user searches for specific topics THEN the system SHALL return results ranked by relevance, quality, and appropriateness

### Requirement 4: Peer Collaboration and Matching System

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to connect with peers, mentors, and study partners who complement my skills and learning goals, so that I can benefit from collaborative learning and peer support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests peer matching THEN the system SHALL suggest at least 3 compatible learning partners within 24 hours
2. WHEN matching peers THEN the system SHALL consider skill complementarity, learning goals, time zones, and communication preferences
3. IF a user is under 18 THEN the system SHALL only match them with verified, age-appropriate peers and require supervised interactions
4. WHEN users collaborate THEN the system SHALL track interaction quality and update matching algorithms accordingly
5. WHEN a user reports inappropriate behavior THEN the system SHALL investigate and take action within 2 hours
6. WHEN forming study groups THEN the system SHALL limit group size to 8 participants maximum for effective collaboration

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Progress Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to see detailed insights about my learning progress, strengths, and areas for improvement, so that I can make informed decisions about my educational journey and stay motivated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes any learning activity THEN the system SHALL update their progress metrics in real-time
2. WHEN displaying progress THEN the system SHALL show completion rates, time spent, comprehension scores, and streak information
3. WHEN a user views their analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide insights about learning patterns and recommendations for improvement
4. IF a user's progress stagnates for 7 days THEN the system SHALL send motivational interventions and suggest alternative learning approaches
5. WHEN calculating progress THEN the system SHALL weight recent performance more heavily than historical data
6. WHEN generating analytics THEN the system SHALL protect user privacy and only share aggregated, anonymized data

### Requirement 6: Adaptive Difficulty and Content Sequencing

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to automatically adjust the difficulty and sequence of content based on my performance, so that I'm always challenged appropriately without becoming frustrated or disengaged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user consistently scores above 90% THEN the system SHALL increase content difficulty within the next 3 learning sessions
2. WHEN a user consistently scores below 60% THEN the system SHALL decrease difficulty and provide additional foundational content
3. WHEN adjusting difficulty THEN the system SHALL maintain a target comprehension rate between 70-85% for optimal learning
4. IF a user requests to skip ahead THEN the system SHALL require a competency test before allowing advancement
5. WHEN sequencing content THEN the system SHALL ensure prerequisite concepts are mastered before introducing dependent topics
6. WHEN difficulty adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL notify the user and explain the reasoning

### Requirement 7: Multi-Platform Integration and Content Aggregation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want seamless access to educational content from multiple platforms and sources through a unified interface, so that I don't have to manage multiple accounts and can focus on learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating external content THEN the system SHALL support YouTube, Khan Academy, Coursera, and GitHub as primary sources
2. WHEN aggregating content THEN the system SHALL maintain metadata about source, difficulty, duration, and learning objectives
3. IF an external service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative content recommendations from available sources
4. WHEN displaying external content THEN the system SHALL track user engagement and completion rates
5. WHEN content is updated on external platforms THEN the system SHALL refresh metadata within 24 hours
6. WHEN users access external content THEN the system SHALL maintain session continuity and progress tracking

### Requirement 8: Safety and Moderation Framework

**User Story:** As a learner (or parent of a minor learner), I want to ensure that all interactions and content are safe, appropriate, and moderated, so that I can learn in a secure environment free from harmful content or interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is added to the platform THEN the system SHALL automatically scan for inappropriate material using AI moderation
2. WHEN users interact THEN the system SHALL monitor conversations for bullying, harassment, or inappropriate behavior
3. IF inappropriate content or behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for human review within 15 minutes
4. WHEN a user reports safety concerns THEN the system SHALL provide immediate response options and escalate to human moderators
5. WHEN minors use the platform THEN the system SHALL implement enhanced safety measures including restricted communication and verified mentor interactions
6. WHEN safety violations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs for investigation and improvement of moderation algorithms
